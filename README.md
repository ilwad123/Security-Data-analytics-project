## Project Summary

The raw datasets were cleaned and transformed using Python. Visualisations were developed to highlight patterns in employee behaviour across systems.

- **Question 6**: Presents detailed visual analyses across each dataset (e.g., login irregularities, file access spikes, USB usage trends)
- **Question 7**: Compiles findings into a final narrative identifying the main suspect, supported by a timeline of correlated activities
